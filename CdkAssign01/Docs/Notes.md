# Devlopement Notes

## Notes on approaches

## Potential improvements in app

* Add dispay of customer information on page!
* State code file to be able to expand the state code into a name
* Provide search page for customers where user could look up by name and other paramaters rather than having to enter ID

## Potential improvements in structure

* Move DAL/BAL into separate project
* build DTO form dataset using LINQ

## Assumptions / Verify with users

* Initial sample data file had what looked like state code and a period ("OR."). Made assumtion to implememnt in DB that this could be represented as a two character code.
